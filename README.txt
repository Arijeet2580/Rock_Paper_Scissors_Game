Rock Paper Scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being titled "stone,") is a hand game originating from China, usually played 
between two individuals, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a shut fist), "paper" (a flat 
hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is alike to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "success" 
or "peace") apart that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.

A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three conceivable outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen 
scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors") But will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper 
will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. 
The game spread from China whereas developing different variants in signs over time.

The code is written in C as well as Python language. Comparatibly it is easy in Python language with comparison to C language.
